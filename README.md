# NLP on PyTorch

## Introduce

this repority is recording Neural language process model 
build by myself according treatises.

## Requirement

- python >= 3.8
- pyTorch >= 2.4
- ...

## Classify By Sources

1. CNN-test-classification source: [Shawn1993/cnn-text-classification-pytorch: CNNs for Sentence Classification in PyTorch (github.com)](https://github.com/Shawn1993/cnn-text-classification-pytorch)

   This Project based on classic treatisehttps://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882，this treatis propose an implementation of a simple model solved binary classification problem with theano structure.

   I rebuild this with pytorch, datasets and transformers.

   The dateils of implementation in blog.keboe.cn with searching “GithubCNN-NLP”
